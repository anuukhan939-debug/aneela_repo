This repository contains a Python-based project that analyzes student academic performance.
The project covers the full workflow: data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Description
The dataset contains student demographics, study habits, attendance, and marks in different subjects.
This project aims to identify patterns in student performance and visualize trends for better interpretation.

## Files in this Repository
- `analysis.py` : Python script for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
- `dataset/student_data.csv` : CSV file containing student performance data.
- Optional: Screenshots of graphs generated in analysis.

## How to Run

2. Install required libraries (if not already installed):

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
3. Run the analysis script:
python analysis.py

## Project Highlights
- Average scores and grade distribution
- Gender-wise and department-wise performance comparison
- Correlation between study hours and total score
- Visualizations: bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps
